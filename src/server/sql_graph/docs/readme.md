## Notes on these libraries

`nx.draw(G)`: This line uses the draw function from NetworkX (nx) to create a visual representation of the graph G. The function uses the matplotlib library internally to create a 2D plot of the graph. The layout of the nodes in the plot is determined automatically. The visualization can be customized using various parameters. You will need to call import matplotlib.pyplot as plt and plt.show() to display the plot in your script.

`PG = nx.nx_pydot.to_pydot(G)`: This line uses the to_pydot function from the nx.nx_pydot module to convert the NetworkX graph G into a PyDot graph object PG. PyDot is a Python library that provides an interface to the Graphviz graph visualization software. The conversion allows you to work with the graph using PyDot functions and methods, generate output in different formats (such as DOT, PNG, or SVG), or apply advanced layout algorithms available in Graphviz.

To use these functions, you will need to have NetworkX, matplotlib, PyDot, and Graphviz installed in your Python environment.
